Standard Event:

teEvent[ StripID ].set( tmeCurrentTime , StartInTime, Duration, Speed , 
AnimationType , Pixel Animation Type, 
Start 1 , Dest 1 , Start 2, Dest 2, 
Pix Start Pos, Pix End Pos, Repeat, Clear on End);

StripID - ID
tmeCurrentTime  - Time event was Created.
StartInTime     - How long to wait before starting animation.
Duration        - How long the Pixel Animation runs.
---
Pix Start Pos   - Channel pixel start pos
Pix End Pos     - Channel pixel start pos
Repeat          - Animation repeats continuously.
Clear on End    - Animtion Clears itself on end.



System Animation Types:

AnEvClear - Clears and Ends all events at a specific time. 
    Example:
        teEvent[0].set(tmeCurrentMillis, X, 0, 0, AnEvClear, 0, CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), X, X, false, false);
    
    Params:
        StartInTime - How long to wait before starting animation.
        Start Pos   - Only Clear Events that have interactions within Start and End Pos.
        End Pos     - Only Clear Events that have interactions within Start and End Pos.

AnEvClearRunning - Clears and Ends all currently running events at a specific time. 
                    Events not started will be preserved. 
    Example:
        teEvent[0].set(tmeCurrentMillis, X, 0, 0, AnEvClear, 0, CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), X, X, false, false);
    
    Params:
        StartInTime - How long to wait before starting animation.
        Start Pos   - Only Clear Events that have interactions within Start and End Pos.
        End Pos     - Only Clear Events that have interactions within Start and End Pos.

AnEvSchedule - 
    Example:
        teEvent[0].set(tmeCurrentMillis, X, 0, 0, AnEvSchedule, AnTaDoorCloseBack, CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), X, X, false, false);

    Params:
        StartInTime - How long to wait before starting animation.
        PARAM6      - Event anmation to call.
        Start Pos   - ????? Unknown
        End Pos     - ????? Unknown

AnEvSetToEnd - 
    Example:
        teEvent[0].set(tmeCurrentMillis, X, X, 0, AnEvSchedule, AnEvSetToEnd, CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(0, 0, 0), CRGB(X, X, X), CRGB(X, X, X), 0, 0, false, false);
        if booRepeat set to true then pulse animations will continue till end of cycle.

    Params:
        StartInTime - How long to wait before starting animation.
        Duration    - How long the Pixel Animation runs.
        Start Color - ????? Unknown
        Start Color - ????? Unknown
        Repeat      - ????? Animation repeats continuously.
            False:  Existing pulse animations will just end.
            True:   Existing pulse animations will continue till it gets to its end. 
        Clear on End- ????? 
            False: 
            True:


Note:
??????  - I don't know if this is working right.
          This is untested.
          I don't know why this is like this.

!!!!!!  - This may work, but I doubt that the results will 
            be appealing.
          Maybe untested, non the less.
