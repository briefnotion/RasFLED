  ToDo:
    - Combine Button class with Button Zone Manager class to simplify the buttons 
        and greatly reduce the amount of code.  The button zones class was originally
        designed with the buttons as being part of its queue list, but there was a
        problem with the window pointers.
    - Update everything properly classified with reference .h, supporting, and helper 
        libraries. (in progress)
    - Create a way to import all animations from an animations file. (finish 
          configuration files first)
    - Clean up 90% of the code. (recursive)
    - Move all the main animations into their own subroutines.
    - Generate animations for shutting down animations.
    - Trace Flicker that occurs when sleep = 0 and doors are closing.
    - Replace vectors with deques.
    - Continue refining animations into an event language that can be ported. 
    - Configuration files. (in progress)
    - Add descriptions in the configuration.cfg file.
    - Thow in some code to allow switchs to groups to respond to multiple "Overhead" 
        and "Door"s within the group.
    - Tie Switches to groups through ID in configuration. 
    - Build a seperate config file for the Door control module so any additional 
        control modules created can be differentiated. 
    - Create an animation profile system to change all animations to another set of 
        animations.  For instance, change from normal animations to prebuilt holiday
        animations. 
    - There were a few more things to list here.  I'll write them down later as 
        needed.
    - Virtual LED Strips, for lack of a better name.  A way for the single LED strip
        to be a composit of two or more other strip, and act as one.  The overhead
        lights can be combined together so that animations can flow from one, to the 
        other, even if the LEDs are in differant portions of the LED strip, or in a 
        differant type of order or orientation.
    - Create alternatives to the console screen.
    - Create a "YOUR ADS HERE" screen.
    - Create an "ENGINE STATUS" screen: speed, temperature, pressure, errors, fuel
        health, and other vehicle stuff.
        - Combine vehicle related info to new animations, and animation events.
    - Create other types of screens.
