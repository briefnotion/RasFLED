  ToDo:
    - Write my own JSON reader and writer.
    - Add blink effect to changed text fields for ADSB display.
    - Add some flashy Cyberpunk Style animations to main screen as eye candy for the 
        bored.
    - Create a Numeric Keypad enter screen.
    - Create a Keyboard Keypad enter screen.
    - Create Play/Pause, Skip button for player.
    - Create scroll bars for Text gadget.
    - Update everything properly classified with reference .h, supporting, and helper 
        libraries. (in progress)
    - Create a way to import all animations from an animations file. (finish 
          configuration files first)
    - Clean up 90% of the code. (recursive)
    - Move all the main animations into their own subroutines.
    - Trace Flicker that occurs when sleep = 0 and doors are closing.
    - Replace vectors with deques.
    - Continue refining animations into an event language that can be ported. 
    - Configuration files. (in progress)
    - Add descriptions in the configuration.cfg file.
    - Thow in some code to allow switchs to groups to respond to multiple "Overhead" 
        and "Door"s within the group.
    - Tie Switches to groups through ID in configuration. 
    - Build a seperate config file for the Door control module so any additional 
        control modules created can be differentiated. 
    - Create an animation profile system to change all animations to another set of 
        animations.  For instance, change from normal animations to prebuilt holiday
        animations. 
    - There were a few more things to list here.  I'll write them down later as 
        needed.
    - Virtual LED Strips, for lack of a better name.  A way for the single LED strip
        to be a composit of two or more other strip, and act as one.  The overhead
        lights can be combined together so that animations can flow from one, to the 
        other, even if the LEDs are in differant portions of the LED strip, or in a 
        differant type of order or orientation.
    - Remove created "ENGINE STATUS" screen: speed, temperature, pressure, errors, fuel
        health, and other vehicle stuff, now that I see it can be done
        - Combine vehicle related info to new animations, and animation events.
    - Create other types of screens. 
    - Create Automated Checklist screen triggered by conditions.
    - Create Conditions monitor to call events.
    - Standardize the color set and transfers accross all gadgets
