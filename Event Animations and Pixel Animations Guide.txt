Standard Event:

teEvent[ StripID ].set( strIdentity , tmeCurrentTime , StartInTime, Duration, Speed , 
                        AnimationType , Pixel Animation Type, 
                        Start 1 , Dest 1 , Start 2, Dest 2, 
                        Pix Start Pos, Pix End Pos, Repeat, Clear on End);

StripID - ID
strIdentity     - Animation text identifier for reference.
tmeCurrentTime  - Time event was Created.
StartInTime     - How long to wait before starting animation.
Duration        - How long the Pixel Animation runs.
---
Pix Start Pos   - Channel pixel start pos
Pix End Pos     - Channel pixel start pos
Repeat          - Animation repeats continuously.
Clear on End    - Animtion Clears itself on end.



Animation Types:

AnEvSweep - Sweep activation of pixels on from Start to End
    
    Speed           - Duration in millis to wait before activating
                        the next pixel in the sweep.
                    
    Pix Start Pos   - Cannel Pixel Position
        to 
    Pix End Pos     - Channel End Postion 

    Start and End can be less or greater than the other. It can 
        go backwards or forwards.


crgbTempStart and crgbTempDest is computed before animation is 
    called based on Start 1 , Dest 1 , Start 2, Dest 2.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coding reference

crgbTempStart and crgbTempDest is computed before call made.

Call: 
tempColor = crgb_anim_color(teDATA[event].intDURATION,
                            teDATA[event].bytLEDANIMATION,
                            crgbTempStart, crgbTempDest, 
                            tmeCurrentTime, tmeStartAnim, 
                            teDATA[event].booCLEARONEND);

Proc:
bigCRGB crgb_anim_color(int intDur, byte bytLedAnimation,
                        CRGB crgbCDest1, CRGB crgbCDest2,
                        unsigned long tmeCurrentTime, unsigned long tmeAnimTime, 
                        boolean booClearOnEnd)

teEvent[ StripID ].set( strIdentity , tmeCurrentTime , StartInTime, Duration, Speed , 
                        AnimationType , Pixel Animation Type, 
                        Start 1 , Dest 1 , Start 2, Dest 2, 
                        Pix Start Pos, Pix End Pos, Repeat, Clear on End);

Pixel Animation Types:
AnPiFade - Simple, low processor use, fade on pixel color from start to end 
    strIdentity - Animation text identifier for reference.
    
    Duration    - Amout of time to change from start to end. 
    Start 1     - Start pixel Color 
    Dest 1      - Ending Pixel Color
    Start 2     - Not Implemented
    Dest 2      - Not Implemented

    Clear on End 
        False   - Keeps the animation running past its expired
            time so that no animations will overwrite its
            Destination Color.
        True    - Event is cleared. Color will stay until 
            overwritten by another animation event. 


AnPiFadeDith - Fade Pixel Colors on 
    strIdentity - Animation text identifier for reference.
    
    Duration    - Amout of time to change from start to end. 

    Start Colors    - is the pixel color at Beginning of animation
    Start 1         - Color of Pixel at Start Postion
    Start 2         - Color of Pixel at End Postion

    Destination Colors  - is the pixel color at End of animation
    Dest 1         - Color of Pixel at Start Postion
    Dest 2         - Color of Pixel at End Postion

    ClearOnEnd:
        False   - Keeps the animation running past its expired
            time so that no animations will overwrite its
            Destination Color.
        True    - Event is cleared. Color will stay until 
            overwritten by another animation event. 


AnPiPulse - Pulses a light from start color to dest color 
    and back to start color

    All Pulses are to be non interfering. Start color is 
        always 0, or clear. 

    strIdentity - Animation text identifier for reference.
    
    Start 1     - Not Implemented
    Dest 1      - Color Pulsing to
    Start 2     - Not Implemented - Dither Not Implemented
    Dest 2      - Not Implemented - Dither Not Implemented

    ClearOnEnd:
        False   - Keeps the animation running past its expired
            time so that no animations will overwrite its
            Destination Color.
        True    - ??????? Event is cleared. Color will stay until 
            overwritten by another animation event. 

    Repeat: 
        True - Pulse will continously repeat 

    For Repeat Puslse set ClearOnEnd = True, Repeat = True      


AnPiPulseTo - Pulses to Color then back back to Color 2
    strIdentity - Animation text identifier for reference.
    
    Start 1     - Color Pulsing to
    Dest 1      - Color Pulsing return (or return) to
    Start 2     - Not Implemented - Dither Not Implemented
    Dest 2      - Not Implemented - Dither Not Implemented

    ClearOnEnd:
        False   - Keeps the animation running past its expired
            time so that no animations will overwrite its
            Destination Color.
        True    - ?????? Event is cleared. Color will stay until 
            overwritten by another animation event. 

    Repeat: 
        False   - Pulse will continously not repeat
        True    - Pulse will continously repeat. 
                    !!!!! Colors will mismatch on repeat pass.

    For Repeat Puslse set ClearOnEnd = True, Repeat = True                    


Note:
??????  - I don't know if this is working right.
          This is untested.
          I don't know why this is like this.

!!!!!!  - This may work, but I doubt that the results will 
            be appealing.
          Maybe untested, non the less.
